# Redux Project

## Overview

---

This project demonstrates how to use Redux to manage the state of a React application. The application includes three main features:

1. **Posts Management**: Allows users to add posts with a title, content, and an auto-generated ID.
2. **Counter**: A simple counter that can be incremented or decremented.
3. **Todo List**: Enables users to add, delete, and filter todos.

## Features

1. **Posts**:
   - Add new posts with a title and content.
   - Each post is assigned a unique ID.

2. **Counter**:
   - Increment and decrement the counter.
   - Display the current count value.

3. **Todo List**:
   - Add new todos.
   - Toggle the completion status of todos.
   - Delete existing todos.
   - Filter todos by their status: all, active, or completed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later) or yarn (v1.22 or later)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/redux-project.git
